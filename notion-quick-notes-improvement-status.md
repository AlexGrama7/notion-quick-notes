# Notion Quick Notes Improvement Status

## Completed Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling System
- Created a comprehensive error system in the backend with:
  - Specific error types with detailed messages
  - Error severity levels (Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
  - Suggested recovery actions
  - User-friendly messages
- Implemented frontend UI components for errors that:
  - Use color-coding based on severity
  - Show contextual action buttons (Try Again, Open Settings, etc.)
  - Display expandable technical details when available

### Backend Improvements
- Updated the error handling in `error.rs` to provide more structured errors
- Added severity levels to classify errors by their impact
- Improved the error information to help users understand and resolve issues
- Removed text reversal logic from the backend

### Offline Queue System
- Implemented IndexedDB storage for offline note queuing
- Created network status detection with reconnection handling
- Added background sync mechanism with retry logic
- Implemented a sync status UI component with indicators and controls
- Added comprehensive error handling for offline scenarios

### API Rate Limiting System
- Implemented a dedicated rate limit manager in `rate_limit.rs` that:
  - Tracks API usage per token
  - Extracts rate limit information from response headers
  - Prevents requests that would exceed limits
  - Provides recommended delay times for rate limited operations
- Integrated rate limiting across all Notion API endpoints:
  - Added pre-request checks for potential rate limiting
  - Added post-request processing of rate limit headers
  - Special handling for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Enhanced error handling for rate limit scenarios with:
  - Detailed error types with retry information
  - User-friendly messages with estimated wait times
  - Proper propagation of rate limit metadata to the UI

## Remaining Issues

### Text Display Issue (RESOLVED)
- Identified that text was being reversed in the UI component regardless of backend reversal
- Implemented a double-reversal solution in the frontend component:
  - Detected reversed text coming from the input
  - Reversed it back to normal order when storing in state
  - Reversed it again for display to counteract the UI's natural reversal
  - This ensures text is displayed correctly to the user and sent correctly to the backend
- Added comprehensive logging for text flow to assist with future debugging
- Modified CSS to ensure consistent text direction across platforms

### Next Steps

1. Expand error handling for more scenarios (Priority #1):
   - âœ… API rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Implement proper session expiration handling with token refresh
   - Add more granular network error classification
   - Create a centralized error tracking system

2. UI/UX Improvements (Priority #2):
   - Add visual confirmation animations for sent notes
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
   - Add dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
   - Improve accessibility for screen readers

3. Performance Optimizations (Priority #3):
   - Conduct performance audit to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize React component rendering
   - Implement virtualization for large note lists
   - Add bundle splitting for faster load times

4. Frontend Rate Limit UI (Priority #1):
   - Add visual indicators when approaching rate limits
   - Create user-friendly rate limit notifications
   - Implement progress bars for remaining quota
   - Add settings to configure rate limit behavior
