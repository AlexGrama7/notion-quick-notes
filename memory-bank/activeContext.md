# Active Context

This document captures the current focus of development and active decisions being made in the Notion Quick Notes application.

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of the application. We've implemented an NLP system that can detect and parse date/time information, action items, priorities, and other entities from user input.

## Recently Completed Work

### NLP Implementation
- Added a comprehensive NLP service that can detect entities in natural language
- Created rule-based entity extraction with the flexibility to use AI in the future
- Implemented processing of structured data for Notion integration
- Added real-time detection of reminders and time-based content
- Built user interface for displaying detected entities and confirming structured data

## Active Technical Decisions

### Natural Language Processing Approach
- Using a hybrid approach that primarily relies on rule-based pattern matching
- Implemented a confidence scoring system to determine when to prompt users for confirmation
- Supporting both automatic processing and explicit user confirmation based on confidence levels
- Designed the system to be extensible for future AI integration

### User Experience for NLP
- Smart detection triggers only when relevant keywords are detected (e.g., "remind", "tomorrow", "schedule")
- Visual highlighting of detected entities with different colors based on entity type
- User has final control with confirmation/rejection options for detected structured data
- Minimally intrusive UI that appears only when relevant content is detected

## Upcoming Work

### NLP Enhancements
- Implement full integration with Notion databases for structured data
- Add more sophisticated pattern recognition for complex time expressions
- Expand entity types to include categories, tags, and status values
- Train the system on user corrections to improve accuracy over time

### Other Priorities
- Continue work on offline performance and queue management
- Enhance integration with Notion API for better handling of rate limits
- Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Open Questions
- What is the best way to handle timezone differences when scheduling reminders?
- How should we handle recurring reminder detection (e.g., "remind me every Monday")?
- What is the right balance between automatic processing and explicit user confirmation?
