# Notion Quick Notes - Product Context

## Problem Statement

Knowledge workers often need to quickly capture thoughts, ideas, or information while working on other tasks, but context switching to a full Notion interface can disrupt their workflow. Additionally, they need their notes to be accessible within their existing knowledge management system (Notion) rather than scattered across different tools.

Key problems addressed:

1. **Friction in Note Capture**: Opening Notion to capture a quick thought creates unnecessary friction and disrupts workflow
2. **Lost Ideas**: Without a fast capture mechanism, fleeting thoughts and ideas are often lost
3. **Data Fragmentation**: Using multiple note-taking tools creates silos of information
4. **Connectivity Limitations**: Traditional web-based tools fail when internet connectivity is lost
5. **Context Switching Cost**: Opening full applications imposes cognitive load
