# Project Progress

This document tracks the current development status of the Notion Quick Notes application, highlighting what has been completed, what is in progress, and known issues.

## Current Status

The application is in active development with the following major features implemented:

- **Core Functionality**: Basic note creation and syncing to Notion
- **Offline Mode**: Ability to create notes while offline that sync when online
- **AI Integration**: AI-powered suggestions for note content
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Smart management of Notion API rate limits
- **Natural Language Processing**: Entity extraction and structured data creation
- **UI Components**: All major interface components are functional

## Completed Features

### Core Features
- ✅ Basic note creation and sending to Notion
- ✅ Settings management (Notion token, page selection)
- ✅ Dark mode toggle
- ✅ Tauri-based cross-platform desktop application

### Sync & Network Features
- ✅ Offline queue for note creation when disconnected
- ✅ Background sync of queued notes when online
- ✅ Network status detection and display
- ✅ Notion API rate limit tracking and visual indicators

### AI Features
- ✅ AI-powered note suggestions
- ✅ Multiple AI model support
- ✅ Fallback mechanism for AI service disruptions
- ✅ Local AI model (LLama) integration

### NLP Features
- ✅ Basic entity extraction (dates, times, actions, priorities)
- ✅ Rule-based pattern matching for common phrases
- ✅ Confidence scoring system for detections
- ✅ User interface for displaying detected entities
- ✅ Confirmation flow for structured data

### UI Improvements
- ✅ Improved error messages with recovery actions
- ✅ Status indicators for network, sync, and rate limit
- ✅ Visual feedback for note sending status
- ✅ Loading states and animations

## In Progress Features

### Notion Integration
- 🔄 Enhanced database integration for structured data
- 🔄 Support for additional Notion block types
- 🔄 Better handling of Notion API errors

### NLP Enhancements
- 🔄 Advanced date/time parsing (recurring events, complex expressions)
- 🔄 Integration with AI models for improved entity detection
- 🔄 Support for additional languages and localization
- 🔄 Learning system to improve detection based on user feedback

### User Experience
- 🔄 Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- 🔄 Note templates and quick actions
- 🔄 Interface for managing queued notes

## Planned Features

### Notion Integration
- ⏳ Two-way sync of notes
- ⏳ Support for Notion databases with custom properties
- ⏳ Integration with Notion pages (not just databases)

### Advanced Features
- ⏳ Note categories and tagging
- ⏳ Rich text formatting
- ⏳ File and image attachments
- ⏳ Notion page preview

### User Experience
- ⏳ Onboarding experience for new users
- ⏳ Customizable themes
- ⏳ Global hotkey to open the app

## Known Issues

### Notion API Integration
- **Rate Limiting**: When multiple notes are queued, the app may hit rate limits. Currently handled by queueing, but needs optimization.
- **Authentication Errors**: Token expiration is not gracefully handled in all cases.

### NLP Implementation
- **Recognition Accuracy**: Entity detection has limitations with complex natural language.
- **Date/Time Parsing**: Some complex time expressions are not correctly identified.
- **Language Support**: Currently optimized for English, with limited support for other languages.
- **Performance**: Pattern matching can be CPU-intensive for lengthy inputs.

### Offline Functionality
- **Sync Conflicts**: When notes are modified both offline and online, conflict resolution is basic.
- **Queue Management**: Limited user interface for managing the offline queue.

### UI Issues
- **Responsiveness**: Some components may have performance issues with large amounts of content.
- **Accessibility**: Some UI elements need improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Recent Progress

### Week of March 17, 2025
- Implemented NLP service for entity extraction from note content
- Added NLPDetection component to display and confirm detected entities
- Integrated entity processing with note creation workflow
- Updated NoteInput component to use NLP service for smart detection
- Added confidence scoring system for entity detection
- Created documentation for NLP system architecture and usage
- Fixed TypeScript errors and improved code quality

### Week of March 10, 2025
- Enhanced AI service with fallback mechanisms
- Added support for local AI models when online services are unavailable
- Improved offline queue management
- Fixed issues with network status detection

## Next Steps

1. Fully integrate NLP-detected structured data with Notion database creation
2. Enhance date/time detection with more complex patterns
3. Improve entity detection accuracy through AI integration
4. Add support for recurrence patterns in reminder detection
5. Implement user preferences for automatic vs. manual entity processing
6. Create more comprehensive test suite for NLP system
