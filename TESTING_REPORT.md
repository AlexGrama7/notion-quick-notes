## Edge Cases and Known Limitations

1. **Network Connectivity**: In very poor network conditions (>1000ms latency), there may still be a slight delay before the offline banner appears.

2. **First-Time Performance**: The first API call after a long period of inactivity (>5 minutes) will still experience the full latency as the cache needs to be refreshed.

3. **Memory Usage**: Under extensive use with very large notes (10,000+ characters), memory usage may still increase, but at a significantly slower rate than in v1.0.

4. **Web Worker Initialization**: On very old browsers or devices, there might be a slight delay (50-100ms) during the first API call as the web worker initializes.

5. **Lazy Loaded Component First Load**: The first time a component is lazy-loaded, there might be a brief visible loading indicator, which doesn't appear on subsequent loads.

## Compatibility Testing

The application was tested on the following environments to ensure broad compatibility:

- Windows 10 (primary target)
- Windows 11
- macOS Monterey
- Ubuntu 22.04

All core functionality and performance improvements were verified across these platforms.

## Conclusion

The extensive testing confirms that all existing functionality from v1.0 has been preserved in v1.1 while achieving significant performance improvements. No regressions were detected in the core features, and the optimizations have resulted in measurable improvements in application responsiveness, resource usage, and user experience.

The application now performs better in all test scenarios, particularly in areas that were previously performance bottlenecks:
1. Text input responsiveness
2. View transitions
3. API call efficiency
4. UI rendering and animations
5. Main thread responsiveness during API operations
6. Initial load time and bundle size

These improvements enhance the user experience without altering the familiar workflow of Notion Quick Notes.
