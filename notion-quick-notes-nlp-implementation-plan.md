# Natural Language Processing Implementation Plan
## Notion Quick Notes - Intelligent Reminder Creation

## 1. Executive Summary

This implementation plan details the strategy for incorporating advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities into Notion Quick Notes. The goal is to enable automatic parsing of natural language inputs like "remind me to buy milk tomorrow at 6 pm" into structured Notion database entries with proper date/time fields and task information. This feature will significantly enhance user productivity by removing the need for manual task formatting and database interaction.

## 2. Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Develop and implement an NLP system that detects dates, times, and action items from natural language input
- Create a parser to convert detected entities into structured data objects
- Extend the Notion API integration to create properly formatted database entries with date fields
- Design a user-friendly feedback system to confirm parsed interpretations
- Ensure functionality works in both online and offline modes

### Success Criteria
- NLP engine correctly identifies >95% of common date/time formats and task intentions
- System successfully converts >90% of parsed inputs into appropriate Notion database entries
- User satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 or higher on the new feature
- Processing time under 500ms for typical inputs

### 3.2 Technical Components

#### NLP Engine
- Utilize a hybrid approach combining:
  - Rule-based parsing with regular expressions for common formats
  - GPT-4o API integration for complex natural language understanding
  - Date/time libraries for standardized parsing

#### Entity Parser
- Extract key entities:
  - Action items (tasks, reminders, notes)
  - Temporal information (dates, times, durations)
  - Priority indicators
  - Context and categories

#### Validation System
- Confirm extracted data meets required formats
- Handle edge cases and ambiguities
- Implement confidence scoring for parsed results

#### Notion Integration
- Extend current API client to support structured database entries
- Map parsed entities to appropriate Notion database fields
- Handle different database schemas flexibly

#### User Feedback System
- Real-time visual indication of parsed entities
- Confirmation prompts for low-confidence interpretations
- Quick correction interface for misinterpreted data
