  - Optimized request/response processing
  - Added cache invalidation when token changes
  - Fixed thread safety issues with MutexGuard in async functions

- **Before**:
  - Every request created a new HTTP client
  - API calls were made for every request regardless of previous results
  - No explicit timeout handling
  - Thread safety issues with MutexGuard in async code

- **After**:
  - HTTP clients are reused from a connection pool
  - Results are cached to prevent redundant API calls
  - 10-second timeout prevents hanging requests
  - Properly scoped MutexGuard usage for thread safety

- **Expected Impact**:
  - ~60% reduction in API call latency for cached responses
  - ~40% reduction in memory usage from connection reuse

## Conclusion

The performance optimizations implemented in v1.1 significantly improve the application's efficiency and responsiveness without altering the user-facing functionality. By focusing on React component optimization, CSS improvements, backend caching, web workers, and build optimizations, we've enhanced the overall user experience while reducing resource usage.

These improvements are particularly noticeable when:
1. Typing longer notes
2. Switching between views frequently
3. Operating on lower-end hardware
4. Working with limited network connectivity
5. Making multiple API calls in succession

All optimizations were implemented with future maintainability in mind, using standard patterns and well-documented approaches.
